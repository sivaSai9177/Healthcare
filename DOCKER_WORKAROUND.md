# Docker Connection Issue Workaround

## Current Situation
- Docker Desktop is running (you can see it in the menu bar)
- Docker commands fail with "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"
- This is a known macOS issue where Docker loses connection to the socket

## Quick Solutions

### Solution 1: Restart Docker Desktop Service
```bash
# From Docker Desktop menu bar:
1. Click Docker icon in menu bar
2. Select "Restart"
3. Wait for "Docker Desktop is running" message
4. Try again: docker ps
```

### Solution 2: Reset Docker Socket (if you have admin access)
```bash
# Reset socket permissions
sudo rm -f /var/run/docker.sock
sudo ln -s ~/.docker/run/docker.sock /var/run/docker.sock
```

### Solution 3: Use Docker Desktop UI
1. Open Docker Desktop app
2. Go to Settings → Advanced
3. Check "System (default)" for Docker socket
4. Apply & Restart

## Working Without Docker

Since Expo is already running from our demo script, you can:

### 1. Access the App
```bash
# The app should be available at:
http://localhost:8081

# If not visible, press 'w' in the terminal running Expo
```

### 2. Use External Database
If you have PostgreSQL installed locally or have access to an external database:

```bash
# Update .env.local with your database URL:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
```

### 3. Demo Features Without Docker
You can still demo:
- ✅ Authentication flow
- ✅ UI/UX and navigation
- ✅ Role-based dashboards
- ❌ Real-time updates (requires WebSocket)
- ❌ Email notifications (requires email service)

## Alternative: Use Docker Commands Directly

If Docker Desktop UI shows containers running, you might be able to:

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to Containers tab
3. Start/stop containers from the UI
4. View logs from the UI

## For Your Demo

Since the app is building (99.9% complete), you should be able to:

1. Open http://localhost:8081 in your browser
2. Login with demo accounts (if you have a database connection)
3. Show the UI and explain the architecture
4. Mention that full functionality requires all services running

## Next Steps

After your demo, to fix Docker permanently:
1. Fully quit Docker Desktop
2. Delete ~/.docker folder
3. Reinstall Docker Desktop
4. This usually fixes socket connection issues
