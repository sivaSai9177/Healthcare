# Staging Deployment Test Setup Complete âœ…

## Summary

I've successfully created a comprehensive staging deployment testing infrastructure for the Healthcare Alert System using Kamal. This enables safe testing of the deployment process before going to production.

## What Was Created

### 1. **Staging Deployment Test Script** (`scripts/deployment/test-staging-deployment.ts`)
A comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Prerequisites (Kamal, Docker, configuration files)
- Docker build process
- Kamal configuration
- Server connectivity
- Deployment simulation (dry run)
- Health endpoint verification
- Generates test reports and deployment checklist

### 2. **Staging Setup Script** (`scripts/deployment/setup-staging.sh`)
An automated setup script that:
- Creates `.env.staging` template
- Validates environment configuration
- Tests SSH connectivity to staging server
- Sets up Kamal secrets
- Tests Docker registry login
- Creates helper scripts (`deploy-staging.sh`, `rollback-staging.sh`)

### 3. **Enhanced Deployment Script**
Updated `manage-deploy.ts` to support staging deployment with:
- Staging-specific configuration loading
- Environment variable management
- Proper Kamal command execution for staging

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
Complete guide covering:
- Quick start instructions
- Pre-deployment checklist
- Architecture overview
- Monitoring and debugging
- Common operations
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations

## Key Features

### Testing Capabilities
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
bun scripts/deployment/test-staging-deployment.ts

# Tests include:
âœ… Prerequisites check
âœ… Docker build test
âœ… Kamal configuration validation
âœ… Server connectivity test
âœ… Deployment dry run
âœ… Health endpoint verification
```

### Deployment Options
```bash
# Option 1: Helper script
./deploy-staging.sh

# Option 2: Management script
bun scripts/deployment/manage-deploy.ts deploy --env=staging

# Option 3: Direct Kamal
kamal deploy -d staging
```

### Monitoring & Operations
```bash
# View logs
kamal app logs -f -d staging

# Check status
kamal app details -d staging

# Rollback
./rollback-staging.sh
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Staging Environment
Create `.env.staging` with your server details:
```bash
./scripts/deployment/setup-staging.sh
# Edit .env.staging with your values
```

### 2. Run Deployment Tests
```bash
bun scripts/deployment/test-staging-deployment.ts
```

### 3. Deploy to Staging
```bash
# If all tests pass:
./deploy-staging.sh
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
- Check health endpoint: `https://staging.your-domain.com/api/health`
- Test authentication flow
- Verify WebSocket connections
- Check database migrations

## Required Configuration

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **Staging Server**
   - Ubuntu 20.04+ or similar
   - Docker installed
   - SSH root access
   - Minimum 2GB RAM, 20GB disk

2. **Environment Variables**
   - `STAGING_SERVER_IP`
   - `DEPLOY_DOMAIN`
   - `DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`

3. **DNS Configuration**
   - A record for `staging.your-domain.com` â†’ staging server IP

## Benefits

1. **Safe Testing**: Test deployment process without affecting production
2. **Automated Validation**: Comprehensive test suite catches issues early
3. **Quick Rollback**: Easy rollback if issues occur
4. **Complete Monitoring**: Full visibility into deployment process
5. **Documentation**: Clear guides for team members

## Important Notes

- First deployment will take 10-20 minutes (pulling images, SSL setup)
- Subsequent deployments are much faster (2-5 minutes)
- Always run tests before deploying
- Keep staging environment close to production configuration
- Regular staging deployments help catch issues early

The staging deployment infrastructure is now ready for testing! ðŸš€
