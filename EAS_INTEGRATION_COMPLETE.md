# EAS Build Integration Complete âœ…

## Summary

I've successfully set up comprehensive EAS (Expo Application Services) build integration for the Healthcare Alert System. This enables automated mobile app builds and deployments for both iOS and Android platforms.

## What Was Created

### 1. **EAS Configuration** (`eas.json`)
- Three build profiles: development, preview, production
- Environment-specific configurations
- Proper resource allocation for builds
- Submit configuration for app stores

### 2. **EAS Management Script** (`scripts/deployment/manage-eas.ts`)
A comprehensive script that handles:
- Initial EAS setup and configuration
- Building apps for different platforms and profiles
- Listing and monitoring build status
- Submitting builds to app stores
- Publishing OTA (Over-The-Air) updates
- Managing credentials
- Updating app store metadata

### 3. **Quick Setup Script** (`scripts/deployment/eas-quick-setup.sh`)
An interactive bash script for:
- Installing EAS CLI
- Checking login status
- Running common EAS operations
- Guided setup process

### 4. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/eas-build.yml`)
Automated CI/CD pipeline that:
- Builds on push to main/production branches
- Supports manual workflow dispatch
- Creates OTA updates automatically
- Handles different build profiles based on branch

### 5. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`docs/guides/EAS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
Complete guide covering:
- Quick start instructions
- Build profiles explanation
- Step-by-step deployment process
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Platform-specific notes
- Security best practices

## Key Features

### Build Profiles
- **Development**: For local testing with simulators
- **Preview**: For internal QA and testing
- **Production**: For app store submission

### Supported Operations
```bash
# Setup EAS
bun scripts/deployment/manage-eas.ts setup

# Build for specific platform
bun scripts/deployment/manage-eas.ts build --platform=ios --profile=preview

# Check build status
bun scripts/deployment/manage-eas.ts status

# Submit to app stores
bun scripts/deployment/manage-eas.ts submit --platform=all

# Publish OTA update
bun scripts/deployment/manage-eas.ts update --message="Bug fixes"
```

### Environment Configuration
Each build profile has its own environment variables:
- API URLs
- WebSocket URLs
- Node environment

## Next Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run the quick setup
   ./scripts/deployment/eas-quick-setup.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Credentials**
   - Update `eas.json` with your Apple ID and team information
   - Add Google Play service account for Android submissions

3. **Test Build Process**
   ```bash
   # Start with a development build
   bun scripts/deployment/manage-eas.ts build --platform=ios --profile=development
   ```

4. **Set Up CI/CD**
   - Add `EXPO_TOKEN` to GitHub secrets
   - Test the GitHub Actions workflow

## Benefits

1. **Automated Builds**: No need for local Xcode or Android Studio
2. **Consistent Environments**: Same build environment for all team members
3. **OTA Updates**: Push JavaScript updates without app store review
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Fully automated deployment pipeline
5. **Multi-Profile Support**: Different configurations for dev/staging/prod

## Important Notes

- EAS requires an Expo account (free tier available)
- iOS builds require Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- Android builds require Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time)
- First build may take 20-40 minutes to set up build environment

The EAS integration is now complete and ready for use! ðŸš€
