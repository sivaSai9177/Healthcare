# MVP Testing Guide

## Overview
I've created comprehensive test scripts to verify all auth features and user flows before your demo. These scripts will help identify any frontend bugs by testing real API endpoints with actual authentication.

## Test Scripts

### 1. Quick MVP Readiness Test
```bash
bun run scripts/test-mvp-ready.ts
```
This script tests:
- Basic API connectivity
- Authentication with test users
- New security features (device fingerprinting, session verification)
- OAuth configuration
- WebSocket connectivity
- Healthcare API endpoints

### 2. Comprehensive User Flow Test
```bash
bun run scripts/test-mvp-comprehensive.ts
```
This script provides deep testing of:
- **All User Roles**: Nurse, Doctor, Operator, Admin, Manager, Head Doctor
- **Complete User Flows**:
  - Nurse: Login → View alerts → Create alert → Acknowledge
  - Doctor: Login → View alerts → Acknowledge → Resolve
  - Operator: Login → Create multiple alerts → View dashboard
  - Admin: Login → Check hospital assignment → Access organization
  - Manager: Login → View analytics → Team management
- **Security Features**:
  - Device fingerprinting collection
  - Session anomaly detection
  - Concurrent session management
  - OAuth flow testing
- **Real-time Features**:
  - WebSocket connections for each role
  - Alert subscriptions
- **Detailed Reporting**:
  - Pass/fail rates
  - Security feature status
  - Recommendations for fixes
  - JSON report generation

## Test Users
The scripts use these test users (password: `test123` for all):
- **Nurse**: doremon@gmail.com
- **Doctor**: johndoe@gmail.com  
- **Operator**: johncena@gmail.com
- **Head Doctor**: saipramod273@gmail.com
- **Admin**: admin@test.com
- **Manager**: manager@test.com

## What These Tests Verify

### Authentication Flow
1. Login with Better Auth v1.2.8
2. Session token generation and validation
3. Role-based access control
4. OAuth configuration (Google Sign-in)
5. Profile completion requirements

### Security Features
1. **Device Fingerprinting**: Collects device info on login
2. **Session Anomaly Detection**: Detects suspicious activity
3. **Concurrent Sessions**: Manages multiple device logins
4. **Session Verification**: Validates active sessions

### Frontend Integration Points
1. Auth hydration issues
2. Loading state handling
3. Role-based navigation
4. Error boundary testing
5. Session persistence

## Running the Tests

1. **Ensure services are running**:
   ```bash
   bun run local:healthcare
   ```

2. **Run quick test first**:
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/test-mvp-ready.ts
   ```

3. **If quick test passes, run comprehensive test**:
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/test-mvp-comprehensive.ts
   ```

4. **Check the generated report**:
   - Look for `MVP_API_TEST_REPORT_*.json` in the project root
   - This contains detailed results and recommendations

## Interpreting Results

### Success Indicators
- ✅ 100% pass rate = MVP ready for demo
- ✅ All security features enabled = Enterprise-grade auth
- ✅ All user flows working = No frontend bugs

### Warning Signs
- ⚠️ 60-80% pass rate = Some features need attention
- ⚠️ Security features unavailable = May need configuration
- ❌ Below 60% = Critical issues to fix

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Login Failures
- Check test user credentials exist in database
- Verify Better Auth is configured correctly
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in .env

### WebSocket Failures
- Check if WebSocket server is running on port 3002
- Verify WS_URL environment variable

### Security Feature Failures
- These are optional enhancements
- Core functionality can work without them
- Enable in production for better security

## Next Steps

1. Run the tests to identify any issues
2. Fix any failing tests based on recommendations
3. Re-run tests to verify fixes
4. Demo with confidence!

The comprehensive test script will help you catch any frontend bugs before the demo by testing real user flows with actual API calls.
