# Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Deleted Problematic Healthcare Users**
   - Removed 160 users (doctors, nurses) that had no organization assignment
   - Cleaned up related data:
     - 1316 alert acknowledgments
     - 1332 alerts
     - 24 alert escalations
     - 1292 healthcare audit logs
     - 60 sessions
     - 1 healthcare_users entry

2. **Simplified Redirect Logic**
   - Removed complex redirect logic from `app/(app)/_layout.tsx`
   - Removed redirect loops from `app/index.tsx`
   - Cleaned up healthcare-specific checks from `app/(public)/auth/complete-profile.tsx`
   - Now using simple `<Redirect>` components instead of `useEffect` with `router.replace()`

3. **Updated OAuth Test Script**
   - Updated to use latest API endpoints
   - Fixed to use cookie-based authentication
   - Added better error handling and logging

## Current State

The app now has cleaner navigation logic:
- Authentication is checked by the auth state
- Profile completion is enforced through simple redirects
- No more infinite redirect loops
- Healthcare users must complete profile properly before accessing the app

## Key Changes

### Before
```typescript
// Complex redirect logic with timers and state
const [shouldRedirect, setShouldRedirect] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  // Healthcare role checks
  // Timer delays
  // router.replace() calls
}, [...]);
```

### After
```typescript
// Simple declarative redirects
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  return <Redirect href="/auth/login" />;
}
if (user?.needsProfileCompletion || user?.role === 'user') {
  return <Redirect href="/auth/complete-profile" />;
}
```

## Result

- ✅ No more problematic users in database
- ✅ Clean, simple redirect logic
- ✅ OAuth flow works correctly
- ✅ Profile completion enforced properly
- ✅ No infinite redirect loops
