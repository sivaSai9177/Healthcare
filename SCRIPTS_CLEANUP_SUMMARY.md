# Scripts Directory Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Completed a comprehensive cleanup of the scripts directory to address issues with outdated patterns, duplicate functionality, hardcoded values, and inconsistent naming conventions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Centralized Configuration
- **File**: `scripts/config/test-users.ts`
  - Centralized test user definitions
  - Environment-based URL configuration
  - Exported helper functions for API, database, and WebSocket URLs
  
- **File**: `scripts/config/utils.ts`
  - Common utilities for script initialization
  - Error handling and logging helpers
  - Port management and service health checks
  - Environment validation

### 2. Converted Critical Shell Scripts to TypeScript

#### Database Reset Script
- **Old**: `scripts/services/startup/db-reset.sh`
- **New**: `scripts/database/reset-database.ts`
- **Improvements**:
  - Type-safe database operations
  - Interactive prompts with safety confirmations
  - Support for both local and cloud databases
  - Proper error handling and cleanup

#### Unified Start Script  
- **Old**: `scripts/services/startup/start-unified.sh`
- **New**: `scripts/services/start-unified.ts`
- **Improvements**:
  - Better process management with cleanup handlers
  - Type-safe configuration
  - Improved error messages
  - Automatic port cleanup

### 3. Consolidated Duplicate Scripts

#### Database Reset Scripts
- Deprecated: `scripts/setup/database/reset-database.ts`
- Deprecated: `scripts/setup/database/reset-database-complete.ts`
- **Consolidated into**: `scripts/database/reset-database.ts`

#### User Management Scripts
- Deprecated: `scripts/users/creation/create-demo-users.ts`
- Deprecated: Multiple other user creation scripts
- **Consolidated into**: `scripts/users/manage-users.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Single script for all user operations
  - Support for create, update, delete, and list
  - API or direct database access options
  - Uses centralized test user configuration

### 4. Fixed Hardcoded Values
- Replaced hardcoded database URLs with environment variables
- Replaced hardcoded API URLs (http://localhost:8081) with configuration
- Moved test user credentials to centralized config

### 5. Added Proper Error Handling
- All new TypeScript scripts include:
  - Try-catch blocks for async operations
  - Cleanup handlers for graceful shutdown
  - Proper exit codes
  - Descriptive error messages

### 6. Created Script Organization Tool
- **File**: `scripts/maintenance/organize-scripts.ts`
- Analyzes all scripts and identifies:
  - Shell scripts that need conversion
  - Scripts with naming issues
  - Potential duplicates
  - Missing error handling

## Migration Guide

### For Database Operations
```bash
# Old way
./scripts/services/startup/db-reset.sh

# New way
bun scripts/database/reset-database.ts
```

### For Starting the Application
```bash
# Old way
./scripts/services/startup/start-unified.sh network

# New way
bun scripts/services/start-unified.ts network
```

### For User Management
```bash
# Old way (multiple scripts)
bun scripts/users/creation/create-demo-users.ts
bun scripts/users/management/update-user-role.ts

# New way (single script)
bun scripts/users/manage-users.ts setup-demo
bun scripts/users/manage-users.ts update user@example.com admin
bun scripts/users/manage-users.ts list
```

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: All critical scripts now use TypeScript
2. **Consistency**: Centralized configuration reduces duplication
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for common values
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and cleanup
5. **Documentation**: Clear usage instructions in each script

## Next Steps

1. Run the organization analysis to identify remaining issues:
   ```bash
   bun scripts/maintenance/organize-scripts.ts
   ```

2. Continue converting remaining shell scripts to TypeScript

3. Rename scripts to follow consistent patterns:
   - `test-*` for testing
   - `setup-*` for initialization
   - `manage-*` for CRUD operations
   - `start-*` for services
   - `debug-*` for debugging

4. Remove deprecated scripts after verifying all functionality is preserved
