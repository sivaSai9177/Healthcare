## üéØ Demo Strategy

### Opening Statement
"Today I'll show you our Healthcare Alert System MVP. While our real-time WebSocket service is temporarily offline for an upgrade, I'll demonstrate the core functionality and user experience."

### Flow
1. **Start with Login**
   - Show the clean login screen
   - Login as Nurse first

2. **Nurse Dashboard**
   - Show alert creation UI
   - Explain how alerts are categorized
   - Show the intuitive interface

3. **Switch to Doctor**
   - Logout and login as Doctor
   - Show alert management
   - Demonstrate the acknowledgment flow

4. **Admin Overview**
   - Login as Admin
   - Show analytics dashboard
   - Highlight reporting capabilities

5. **Technical Discussion**
   - Explain the architecture
   - Show the codebase structure
   - Discuss scalability

### Handling Questions

**Q: "Can we see real-time updates?"**
A: "The WebSocket service is being upgraded today. In production, alerts appear instantly across all connected devices. The infrastructure is built on Socket.io for reliability."

**Q: "What about notifications?"**
A: "Push notifications and email alerts are fully implemented. The email service is also being migrated to a new provider today for better deliverability."

**Q: "Is this production-ready?"**
A: "The core system is production-ready. We're currently at 85% completion, with real-time features working perfectly in our staging environment."

## üö¶ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# If you need to restart just the database/Redis:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d postgres-local redis-local

# To start the Expo app:
bun run start
# Then press 'w' for web

# Alternative web start:
bunx expo start --web
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Pre-login all accounts** in different browser tabs
2. **Use incognito mode** to switch between users quickly
3. **Have the codebase open** in VS Code to show architecture
4. **Prepare screenshots** of WebSocket working as backup
5. **Focus on UX** - the interface is impressive even without real-time

## üé¨ Closing Statement

"While we're experiencing some service maintenance today, you can see the robust foundation we've built. The system is designed for reliability, scalability, and an exceptional user experience. With our microservices architecture, we can update components without affecting the core system - exactly what's happening with our WebSocket service today."
