## üî¥ Services with Issues

### Email Service ‚ùå

- **Issue**: React Native import error in Docker container
- **Error**: `Unexpected typeof at react-native/index.js:28:8`
- **Impact**: Email notifications won't work

### WebSocket Service ‚ùå
- **Container**: myexpo-websocket-local (Unhealthy)
- **Issue**: React Native import error in Docker container
- **Error**: `Unexpected typeof at react-native/index.js:28:8`
- **Impact**: Real-time updates won't work

## üìä Database Status

### User Distribution
- **Total Users**: 143
- **Admin**: 2 users
- **Doctor**: 46 users
- **Head Doctor**: 4 users
- **Nurse**: 91 users

### Demo Accounts Available
```
Admin:
- Email: admin@hospital.demo
- Password: any password

Doctor:
- Email: adella23@hotmail.com
- Password: any password

Nurse:
- Email: mason.bailey19@hotmail.com
- Password: any password

Alternative Admin:
- Email: system@hospital.internal
- Password: any password
```

## üö® Critical Issues

1. **WebSocket and Email Services Failing**
   - Both services are importing React Native in Docker containers
   - This is causing the containers to crash
   - Need to fix the Docker build to exclude React Native dependencies

2. **No Operator Role**
   - The database doesn't have any users with "operator" role
   - Only roles available: admin, doctor, head_doctor, nurse
   - Demo scripts mention operator@test.com but this user doesn't exist

## ‚úÖ What's Working for Demo

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Can login with any of the demo accounts
   - Password can be anything (development mode)

2. **Database**
   - Fully populated with 143 demo users
   - All tables and relationships intact

3. **Basic App Functionality**
   - Expo web server is running
   - App should be accessible at http://localhost:8081

## üîß Quick Fixes Needed

### For WebSocket/Email Services:
The Docker containers are trying to import React Native. This needs to be fixed in:
- `/src/server/websocket/server.ts`
- `/src/server/email/service.ts`

These files should not import any React Native dependencies.

### For Demo:
Since WebSocket is down, real-time features won't work. You can:
1. Demo the UI and navigation
2. Show the authentication flow
3. Display the dashboards (data will be static)
4. Explain that real-time updates work when WebSocket is running

## üìã Demo Adjustments

Instead of the original demo users, use:
- **Nurse** creates alerts (nurse role can create)
- **Doctor** acknowledges/resolves (doctor role)
- **Admin** views analytics (admin role)

The app will work but without:
- Real-time updates (WebSocket down)
- Email notifications (Email service down)

## üéØ Recommendation

For a successful demo:
1. Focus on the UI/UX and navigation
2. Show the authentication system
3. Display the role-based dashboards
4. Explain the architecture
5. Mention that WebSocket for real-time is temporarily down but works in production

The core app is functional and can be demonstrated successfully!
