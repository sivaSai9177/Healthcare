# Fix for getSession 500 Error

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in auth.ts

**File:** `/src/server/routers/auth.ts`

- Added comprehensive try-catch wrapper around the entire getSession endpoint
- Enhanced error logging with detailed error information including:
  - Error message and stack trace
  - Zod validation errors if present
  - Database query errors
- Added proper date parsing function to handle Date/string conversions
- Changed database error from warning to error level logging
- Added validation logging before schema parsing
- Now throws proper TRPC error instead of silently returning null for unexpected errors

### 2. Environment Variable Validation

**File:** `/app/api/auth/[...auth]+api.ts`

- Added startup validation for critical environment variables
- Enhanced error response when auth handler is not initialized
- Includes environment variable status in error details (dev mode only)

### 3. Debug Tools

**Created:** `/app/api/debug/session+api.ts`
- New debug endpoint to test session retrieval directly
- Shows raw session data and environment status
- Helps identify if issue is with Better Auth or TRPC layer

**Created:** `/scripts/test-session-endpoint.ts`
- Test script to check both debug and TRPC endpoints
- Verifies environment variables
- Can be run with: `npm run tsx scripts/test-session-endpoint.ts`

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Date Handling Issues**: Dates from the session might be strings that need proper conversion
2. **Schema Validation**: The SessionResponseSchema expects Date objects but might receive strings
3. **Database Query Errors**: DB errors were only logged as warnings and execution continued
4. **Missing Error Context**: Errors were caught but not properly logged with full context

## How to Debug

1. Check the server logs for detailed error messages with the new logging
2. Run the test script: `npm run tsx scripts/test-session-endpoint.ts`
3. Visit `/api/debug/session` in your browser to see raw session data
4. Look for these specific error patterns:
   - "Database query failed in getSession" - DB connection issue
   - "Session validation error in getSession" - Schema validation issue
   - "Unexpected error in getSession endpoint" - Other unexpected errors

## Next Steps if Error Persists

1. Check if environment variables are set:
   ```bash
   echo $BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
   echo $DATABASE_URL
   echo $BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL
   ```

2. Check database connection:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push  # Ensure DB schema is up to date
   ```

3. Clear browser cookies and try again (session might be corrupted)

4. Check the detailed logs - they now include:
   - Exact error messages
   - Stack traces
   - Zod validation errors
   - User and session IDs involved

The enhanced logging should now provide clear information about what's causing the 500 error.
