- [x] `/app/api/auth/[...auth]+api.ts` ✅
  - Replaced all console.* with logger.* (11 instances)
  - Proper API request/response logging

- [x] `/app/(auth)/login.tsx` ✅
  - Added logger import and replaced TODO comments (3 instances)

- [x] `/app/(auth)/register.tsx` ✅
  - Added logger import and replaced console.error (2 instances)

- [x] `/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx` ✅
  - Replaced all TODO logging comments (6 instances)

- [x] `/app/_layout.tsx` ✅
  - Replaced TODO comments with logger.system.* (3 instances)

## Phase 2: TypeScript Issues ✅

### Completed:
- [x] Fixed @ts-ignore in auth-client.ts ✅
  - Created properly typed wrapper for getSession
  - Used type assertion instead of @ts-ignore

### Remaining:
- [ ] Add proper Session type export from auth-store
- [ ] Fix AppState event listener types properly

## Phase 3: Security Improvements ✅

### Completed:
- [x] Environment variable validation ✅
  - Added proper error throw for missing BETTER_AUTH_SECRET in production
  - Removed hardcoded fallback

### Remaining:
- [ ] Enhanced cookie security settings
- [ ] CSRF validation for OAuth state
- [ ] Mobile session encryption layer

## Phase 4: Error Handling Standardization ✅

### Completed:
- [x] Created comprehensive error handling utility ✅
  - `/lib/auth/error-handling.ts`
  - Standardized error codes
  - User-friendly messages
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Rate limiting detection

### Remaining:
- [ ] Update all auth components to use new error handling
- [ ] Create shared error display components

## Phase 5: Code Organization ✅

### Completed:
- [x] Created session utilities ✅
  - `/lib/auth/session-utils.ts`
  - Centralized session management
  - Caching for performance
  - Activity tracking
  - Device ID management

### Remaining:
- [ ] Split auth-server.ts into smaller modules
- [ ] Extract auth-client.ts sign-out logic
- [ ] Remove duplicate error handling code

## Phase 6: UX Improvements

### Not Started:
- [ ] Add skeleton loaders for auth flows
- [ ] Progress indicators for OAuth
- [ ] Session refresh notifications
- [ ] Better error feedback UI

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization

### Not Started:
- [ ] Implement smart session caching
- [ ] Add debouncing to email validation
- [ ] Optimize session checks
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary API calls

## Structured Logging Integration Status

### DebugPanel Integration:
- [x] All logs flow to DebugPanel ✅
- [x] Filterable by log level ✅
- [x] Searchable logs ✅
- [x] Export functionality ✅
- [ ] Real-time log streaming
- [ ] Log persistence across sessions

### Log Categories Implemented:
- [x] AUTH - Authentication events ✅
- [x] API - API requests/responses ✅
- [x] TRPC - TRPC procedure calls ✅
- [x] STORE - Zustand store updates ✅
- [x] ROUTER - Navigation events ✅
- [x] SYSTEM - System events ✅
- [x] ERROR - Error logs ✅

### Debug Store Integration:
- [x] enableAuthLogging toggle ✅
- [x] enableTRPCLogging toggle ✅
- [x] enableRouterLogging toggle ✅
- [ ] Log level filtering
- [ ] Category-specific settings

## Testing Tools

### Automated Test Script:
- Created `/scripts/test-unified-logging.ts`
- Run with: `bun run scripts/test-unified-logging.ts`
- Tests all logging categories and features
- Includes performance benchmarking

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:
- [ ] Test login flow with structured logging
- [ ] Test logout flow with structured logging
- [ ] Test OAuth flow with structured logging
- [ ] Verify logs appear in DebugPanel
- [ ] Test log filtering in DebugPanel
- [ ] Test log export functionality
- [ ] Test error handling for various scenarios
- [ ] Test session management utilities

### Edge Cases to Test:
- [ ] Rate limiting errors
- [ ] OAuth cancellation
- [ ] Network failures
- [ ] Session expiration
- [ ] Concurrent auth requests
- [ ] Profile completion flow
- [ ] Email verification flow

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Must Complete Before Production:
- [ ] Remove all remaining console.log statements
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add session encryption for mobile
- [ ] Complete error handling migration
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for auth errors
- [ ] Performance testing with logging enabled
- [ ] Security audit of session handling

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Log aggregation service integration
- [ ] Auth metrics dashboard
- [ ] Automated security testing
- [ ] Load testing for auth endpoints

## Notes & Observations

1. **Unified Logger Benefits:**
   - Consistent logging format across the app
   - Easy filtering and searching in DebugPanel
   - Performance-conscious with level filtering
   - Integrates with existing debug store settings

2. **Areas Needing Attention:**
   - Large auth-server.ts file (832 lines) needs splitting
   - Some components still using inline error handling
   - OAuth error handling could be more robust
   - Session refresh UX needs improvement

3. **Security Improvements Made:**
   - No more hardcoded secrets
   - Proper error messages that don't leak info
   - Session validation improvements
   - Device ID tracking for security

4. **Next Priority Actions:**
   1. Complete TypeScript fixes
   2. Implement CSRF protection
   3. Add mobile session encryption
   4. Create shared error components
   5. Add skeleton loaders
