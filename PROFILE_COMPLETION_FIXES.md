# Profile Completion Screen Fixes

## Dark Mode Fixes Applied

1. **Text Color Fixes**
   - Changed all `<Text className="text-sm font-medium">` to `<Text size="sm" weight="medium" color="foreground">`
   - Changed all error text from `className="text-destructive text-sm"` to `size="sm" color="destructive"`
   - Changed muted text from `className="text-gray-500"` to `color="muted"`
   - Changed warning text from `className="text-amber-600"` to `color="warning"`

2. **Input Label Fixes**
   - Removed separate Text components for labels
   - Now using Input component's built-in `label` prop
   - Set `floatingLabel={false}` to use static labels
   - Input component handles theme colors automatically

3. **Button Text Color Fixes**
   - Updated Button component to use explicit theme colors
   - Primary/Destructive buttons: `theme.primaryForeground` (white in dark mode)
   - Outline/Ghost/Secondary buttons: `theme.foreground` (adapts to theme)
   - Link buttons: `theme.primary`

4. **Checkbox Border Colors**
   - Changed hardcoded colors `#2563eb` and `#d1d5db` to theme colors
   - Now using `theme.primary` and `theme.border` for proper dark mode support

5. **Progress Indicator**
   - Changed inactive step color from `bg-gray-300` to `bg-muted`
   - This ensures visibility in both light and dark modes

6. **Bio Textarea Improvements**
   - Changed placeholder to be more descriptive
   - Increased height from 4 to 6 lines
   - Added proper padding (top/bottom: 12px)
   - Set minimum height to 120px
   - Added `variant="filled"` for better visual distinction
   - Fixed label/placeholder overlap issue

7. **Animated Checkboxes**
   - Created custom `AnimatedCheckbox` component
   - Added spring animations on press (scale: 0.9 → 1.0)
   - Animated checkmark appearance with spring effect
   - Added haptic feedback on press
   - Added hover effect for web (subtle background glow)
   - Uses theme colors for proper dark mode support
   - Maintains all original animations with system theming

## Organization Requirement Changes

1. **Healthcare Roles (doctor, nurse, head_doctor, operator)**
   - Organization is now **OPTIONAL** (was incorrectly marked as required)
   - Hospital assignment is now **OPTIONAL** 
   - Only **Department** is required for healthcare roles

2. **Backend Behavior**
   - If healthcare role provides organization name, the system will:
     - Create a new healthcare organization
     - Automatically create a default hospital for that organization
     - Assign the user to both
   - If no organization is provided, user can still complete profile
   - Hospital/organization can be assigned later

## Summary

The profile completion screen now:
- ✅ Works properly in dark mode with correct text colors
- ✅ Has theme-aware checkbox borders
- ✅ Shows progress indicators clearly in both light/dark modes
- ✅ Correctly marks organization as optional for healthcare roles
- ✅ Only requires department for healthcare roles
