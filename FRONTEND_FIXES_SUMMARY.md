# Frontend Fixes Summary

## TypeScript Errors Fixed

### 1. Text Size Issues ✅
- Changed `size="md"` to `size="base"` (md is not a valid size)
- Changed `size="default"` to `size="base"` (default is not a valid text size)

### 2. Button Issues ✅
- Changed Button `size="md"` to `size="default"`
- Removed `colorTheme="error"` and used `variant="destructive"` instead
- Removed `icon` prop and wrapped content in HStack with icon

### 3. Layout Issues ✅
- Changed `justifyContent="between"` to `justifyContent="space-between"`
- Fixed transition style to only apply on web: `...(Platform.OS === 'web' ? { transition: 'width 0.3s ease-out' } : {})`

### 4. Component Issues ✅
- Changed Box with onPress to TouchableOpacity (Box doesn't support onPress)
- Fixed Select onValueChange type casting: `onValueChange={(value) => setDepartmentFilter(value as string)}`

### 5. Auth Store Issues ✅
- Added `lastActivity` to useAuth hook export
- Fixed `useAuth.getState()` to `useAuthStore.getState()`

### 6. API Endpoint Issues ✅
- Commented out non-existent endpoints in invitations.tsx:
  - `getPendingInvitations` (doesn't exist)
  - `cancelInvitation` (doesn't exist)
  - `reviewJoinRequest` (doesn't exist)
- Changed `getMembers` to `getMembersWithHealthcare` (correct endpoint)

### 7. Navigation Routes Fixed ✅
- Fixed 21 incorrect navigation routes (see FRONTEND_VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md)
- Fixed 11 Redirect components to use proper route groups

### 8. Enhanced Hooks Implementation ✅
- Updated MetricsOverview.tsx to use `useMetrics` enhanced hook with offline support

## Remaining Issues

### TypeScript Errors (50 total in app directory)
Most are minor issues:
- Button loading prop type issues
- Card variant "secondary" not existing (use "outline")
- Unused variables from destructuring

### ESLint Errors
Main issues to fix:
1. **React Hooks Rules**: Hooks being called after conditional returns in:
   - alerts/index.tsx
   - patients.tsx
   - alerts/[id].tsx

2. **Unused Variables**: Remove unused error variables from catch blocks

3. **Unescaped Entities**: Use HTML entities for apostrophes

### Expo Doctor Issues
1. **app.json schema**: Remove `cli` and `build` properties
2. **React Native Directory**: Many packages don't have metadata (can be ignored)

## Build Status
- TypeScript: 50 errors remaining in app directory (down from many more)
- ESLint: ~13 errors, mostly React hooks rules
- Expo Doctor: 2 non-critical issues

## Next Steps
1. Fix React hooks order issues by moving all hooks before conditional returns
2. Remove unused variables
3. Update app.json to remove invalid properties
4. Run build to verify everything compiles

The app should now be ready for testing once these remaining minor issues are fixed.
