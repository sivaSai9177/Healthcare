3. `ResponseAnalyticsDashboard.test.tsx` - ❌ 10 tests failing (import errors)

## Known Issues

### 1. Database Connection (Integration Tests)
```
ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined
```
- **Cause**: pg library requires TextEncoder polyfill
- **Status**: Partially fixed in jest.setup.js
- **Solution**: Need to mock database connections

### 2. Component Import Errors
```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) 
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
```
- **Cause**: Missing or incorrect component exports
- **Status**: Under investigation
- **Solution**: Audit component exports/imports

### 3. TRPC Mock Issues
```
TypeError: api.useUtils is not a function
```
- **Cause**: Incomplete TRPC mock implementation
- **Status**: Partially fixed
- **Solution**: Complete mock alignment with actual TRPC

- PostgreSQL and Redis services
- Coverage reporting with Codecov
- Tests run with `continue-on-error: true` (temporary)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Integration Tests** (High Priority)
   - Mock database connections
   - Remove real service dependencies
   - Use in-memory test data

2. **Fix Component Tests** (Medium Priority)
   - Resolve import errors
   - Complete TRPC mocks
   - Consider snapshot testing

3. **Expand Coverage** (Low Priority)
   - Add more unit tests
   - Implement E2E tests
   - Add accessibility tests

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Test infrastructure complete
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
- ✅ Unit tests at 100%
- ❌ Integration tests executing
- ⚠️ Component tests partial
- ⚠️ Overall coverage at 40% (target: 80%)
