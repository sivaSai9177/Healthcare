# App Directory Backup Summary

## Backup Created: 2025-06-16

The following old directories have been moved to `../app_directory_backup/` for safekeeping:

### Backed Up Folders:

1. **`(auth)/`** - Old authentication screens
   - Replaced by: `app/(public)/auth/`
   - Contains: login, register, forgot-password, verify-email, complete-profile

2. **`(healthcare)/`** - Old healthcare role-based folder
   - Replaced by: Feature-based organization in `app/(app)/`
   - Contains: dashboard, alerts, patients, shift-handover, etc.

3. **`(home)/`** - Old home/dashboard screens
   - Replaced by: `app/(app)/(tabs)/` and role-specific dashboards
   - Contains: index, operator-dashboard, admin, manager, settings, etc.

4. **`(organization)/`** - Old organization screens
   - Replaced by: `app/(app)/organization/`
   - Contains: dashboard and related screens

5. **`(admin)/`** - Old admin screens
   - Replaced by: `app/(app)/admin/`
   - Contains: audit, system screens

6. **`(manager)/`** - Old manager-specific folder
   - Replaced by: Manager features integrated into main app structure
   - Was mostly empty/redirect files

### Files Kept in Place:

These files remain in the app directory as they're still needed:

- `auth-callback.tsx` - OAuth callback handler
- `clear-session.tsx` - Session clearing utility
- `+not-found.tsx` - 404 handler
- `_layout.tsx` - Root layout
- `index.tsx` - Root redirect logic

### New Structure Benefits:

1. **Feature-based organization** instead of role-based
2. **Clear route groups**: (public), (app), (modals)
3. **Consistent patterns** across all screens
4. **Better code discovery** and maintainability

### Recovery Instructions:

If needed, the old structure can be recovered from:
```bash
../app_directory_backup/
```

However, all functionality has been successfully migrated to the new structure with improved organization and standards compliance.
