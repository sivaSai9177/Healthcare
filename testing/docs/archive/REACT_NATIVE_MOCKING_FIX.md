# React Native Mocking Fix Summary

## Problem
Component and integration tests were failing with various errors when trying to test React Native components in Jest. The main issues were:

1. `Cannot find module 'react-native/Libraries/Animated/NativeAnimatedHelper'`
2. `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getColorScheme')`
3. `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')` from TurboModuleRegistry
4. Various import errors for expo modules
5. Font and asset import errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive Component Test Setup
Created `jest.setup.components.js` with proper mocks for:
- React Native core modules
- React Native Reanimated
- Expo modules (router, haptics, symbols, vector-icons)
- React Native CSS Interop
- Nativewind
- Gesture Handler
- Safe Area Context

### 2. Fixed Module Resolution
Updated `jest.config.js`:
- Added proper moduleNameMapper for reanimated and assets
- Updated transformIgnorePatterns to include all necessary modules
- Created separate test environment for component tests

### 3. Created Mock Files
- `__mocks__/react-native-reanimated.js` - Complete mock for animation library
- `__mocks__/fileMock.js` - Mock for font and image assets

### 4. Fixed Import Issues
- Fixed Button import path from `form` to `interaction` directory
- Added mock for glass-theme hook
- Mocked all vector icon libraries

## Files Modified/Created

1. **jest.config.js** - Updated module mapping and transforms
2. **jest.setup.components.js** - Complete component test setup
3. **__mocks__/react-native-reanimated.js** - Reanimated mock
4. **__mocks__/fileMock.js** - Asset mock
5. **Component test files** - Removed redundant mocks

## Key Mocking Patterns

### React Native Reanimated
```javascript
module.exports = {
  default: {
    createAnimatedComponent: (Component) => Component,
    View: RN.View,
    // ... other components
  },
  useSharedValue: jest.fn(() => ({ value: 0 })),
  useAnimatedStyle: jest.fn(() => ({})),
  // ... other hooks
};
```

### Expo Modules
```javascript
jest.mock('expo-haptics', () => ({
  impactAsync: jest.fn(),
  ImpactFeedbackStyle: {
    Light: 'light',
    Medium: 'medium',
    Heavy: 'heavy',
  },
}));
```

### Asset Handling
```javascript
moduleNameMapper: {
  '\\.(ttf|otf|eot|svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif)$': '<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js',
}
```

## Testing Status

- âœ… Unit tests: 35/35 passing
- ðŸš§ Component tests: Mocking infrastructure complete, ready for test implementation
- ðŸš§ Integration tests: Mocking infrastructure complete, ready for test implementation

## Next Steps

1. Write the actual component tests now that mocking is fixed
2. Implement integration tests for complete user flows
3. Add visual regression tests
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with all tests

## Lessons Learned

1. React Native testing requires extensive mocking due to native dependencies
2. Module resolution order matters - mocks must be set up before imports
3. Different test environments (node vs jsdom) need different configurations
4. Asset imports need special handling in Jest
5. Comprehensive mocking setup is essential for React Native component testing
