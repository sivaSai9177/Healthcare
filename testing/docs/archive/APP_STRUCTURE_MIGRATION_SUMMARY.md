# App Structure Migration Summary

## Healthcare Module Fixes Completed

### 1. Fixed API Permissions (403 Error)
- Updated `/src/server/trpc.ts` to include `view_healthcare_data` permission for all healthcare roles
- Changed `getMetrics` endpoint to use `healthcareProcedure` instead of `viewAlertsProcedure`
- All healthcare roles now have proper access to metrics API

### 2. Fixed Scrolling Issues
- Removed `flexGrow: 1` from ScrollView contentContainerStyle
- Added `scrollEnabled` prop to nested components (AlertList, ActivePatients)
- Passed `scrollEnabled={Platform.OS === 'web'}` to prevent nested scrolling conflicts on mobile

### 3. Fixed iOS Modal Navigation
- Added close button for iOS modal presentation
- Healthcare dashboard now properly handles modal presentation mode

### 4. Fixed API Import Path
- Corrected import from `@/lib/trpc` to `@/lib/api/trpc`

## Industry Standard App Structure Implementation

### New Folder Structure (Expo Router v2 Route Groups)
```
app/
├── (public)/                 # Unauthenticated routes
│   └── auth/
│       ├── login.tsx
│       ├── register.tsx
│       ├── verify-email.tsx
│       └── complete-profile.tsx
├── (app)/                    # Authenticated routes
│   ├── (tabs)/              # Tab navigation
│   │   ├── _layout.tsx      # Tab layout with role-based rendering
│   │   ├── home.tsx         # Main dashboard (renders role-specific)
│   │   ├── alerts.tsx       # Alert management
│   │   ├── patients.tsx     # Patient management (healthcare only)
│   │   └── settings.tsx     # User settings
│   ├── alerts/              # Alert detail screens
│   │   ├── [id].tsx         # Individual alert details
│   │   ├── history.tsx      # Alert history
│   │   └── escalation-queue.tsx
│   └── shifts/              # Shift management
│       └── handover.tsx
├── (modals)/                # Modal screens
│   ├── create-alert.tsx
│   └── escalation-details.tsx
└── index.tsx                # Root redirect logic
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Feature-Based Organization**
   - Replaced role-based folders with feature-based structure
   - Alerts, patients, and shifts are now organized by feature
   - Role-specific rendering handled within components

2. **Simplified Navigation**
   - Single tab layout that adapts based on user role
   - Removed duplicate dashboard files
   - Clear separation between public/authenticated routes

3. **Better Route Groups**
   - `(public)` - Unauthenticated routes
   - `(app)` - Authenticated app routes
   - `(modals)` - Modal presentations

4. **Role-Specific Dashboards**
   - Created separate dashboard components for each role
   - Main home screen renders appropriate dashboard based on user role
   - Maintains clean separation of concerns

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `/app/(public)/_layout.tsx` - Public routes layout
- `/app/(public)/auth/*.tsx` - Auth screens (moved from (auth))
- `/app/(app)/_layout.tsx` - Authenticated routes layout
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Tab navigation
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/home.tsx` - Main home screen
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/alerts.tsx` - Alert management
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/patients.tsx` - Patient management
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - Settings screen
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/home/operator-dashboard.tsx`
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/home/healthcare-dashboard.tsx`
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/home/admin-dashboard.tsx`
- `/app/(app)/(tabs)/home/manager-dashboard.tsx`
- `/app/(app)/alerts/[id].tsx` - Alert detail
- `/app/(app)/alerts/history.tsx` - Alert history
- `/app/(app)/alerts/escalation-queue.tsx`
- `/app/(app)/shifts/handover.tsx` - Shift handover

#### Modified Files:
- `/app/index.tsx` - Updated to redirect to new route structure
- `/app/_layout.tsx` - Added new route group configurations

### Benefits of New Structure

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Features are self-contained
   - Easy to find related code
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Better Scalability**
   - Easy to add new features
   - Role-based access control in layouts
   - Modular architecture

3. **Consistent Navigation**
   - Single source of truth for tabs
   - Role-specific rendering within components
   - Cleaner URL structure

4. **Industry Standards**
   - Follows React Native/Expo best practices
   - Feature-based organization
   - Clear public/private route separation

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of remaining screens
2. Remove old duplicate files
3. Update all import paths
4. Test all user flows for each role
5. Update documentation
