# Connectivity Error Fix Documentation

## Problem
The app was showing console errors for aborted Google connectivity check requests:
```
[ERROR] [Network] HEAD https://clients3.google.com/generate_204 - Failed (87ms) AbortError: Aborted
```

## Root Cause
Some library or system component is performing connectivity checks using Google's `generate_204` endpoint. When these requests are aborted (due to timeout or network changes), they appear as errors in the console, creating noise and potential confusion.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Console Interceptor Enhancement
**File:** `components/blocks/debug/utils/console-interceptor.ts`

Added intelligent filtering for connectivity check errors:
- Created a list of known connectivity check URLs
- Added `isConnectivityCheckError()` function to detect these specific errors
- Modified console.error to log connectivity check errors as debug instead of error level

### 2. Error Detection Hook Update
**File:** `hooks/useErrorDetection.ts`

Enhanced error handling to recognize and filter connectivity check errors:
- Added 'connectivity-check' to ErrorType enum
- Created `isConnectivityCheckError()` helper function
- Updated `handleTRPCError` to ignore connectivity check errors

### 3. Error Recovery Enhancement
**File:** `lib/error/error-recovery.ts`

Updated retry logic to:
- Exclude connectivity check errors from retry attempts
- Add AbortError as a retryable error type (for non-connectivity checks)
- Prevent unnecessary retry attempts on known connectivity probes

### 4. Network Probe Manager (New)
**File:** `lib/error/network-probe.ts`

Created a proper network connectivity checking system:
- Uses multiple reliable endpoints for connectivity checks
- Implements proper timeout and abort handling
- Caches results to prevent excessive probing
- Provides clean API for connectivity checks

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console Output**: Connectivity check errors are now logged at debug level
2. **Better Error Tracking**: Real errors are not mixed with connectivity probes
3. **Improved Performance**: Connectivity check errors don't trigger retry logic
4. **Reliable Connectivity Detection**: New network probe manager provides accurate connectivity status

## Usage

### Check Network Connectivity
```typescript
import { networkProbe } from '@/lib/error/network-probe';

// Check connectivity
const result = await networkProbe.check();
if (result.isOnline) {
  console.log(`Online with ${result.latency}ms latency`);
} else {
  console.log('Offline:', result.error?.message);
}
```

### Error Detection Hook
The hook now automatically filters connectivity check errors:
```typescript
const { error, isOnline, handleTRPCError } = useErrorDetection();
// Connectivity check errors are automatically filtered out
```

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Monitor console output - connectivity check errors should no longer appear as errors
2. Check debug logs - connectivity check errors should appear as debug messages
3. Verify real network errors are still properly caught and displayed
4. Test the network probe manager returns accurate connectivity status

## Future Improvements

1. Add configuration to customize connectivity check URLs
2. Implement exponential backoff for connectivity probes
3. Add metrics tracking for connectivity check performance
4. Consider replacing the system's connectivity checks with our custom implementation
