## In Progress 🚧

### TypeScript
- [ ] Remaining ~2,380 errors (mostly test file prop mismatches)
- [ ] Admin/organization component type errors
- [ ] ESLint warnings (1,803 issues)

### Testing
- [ ] Component render tests (blocked by testing library issues)
- [ ] Integration tests for user flows
- [ ] API endpoint testing

## Not Started ❌

### Testing Coverage

- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright for web)
- [ ] Visual regression tests
- [ ] Accessibility tests
- [ ] Security tests
- [ ] Load/performance tests
- [ ] API contract tests
- [ ] Mutation testing

### CI/CD
- [ ] GitHub Actions pipeline
- [ ] Automated test runs
- [ ] Coverage reporting
- [ ] Deploy pipeline

## Critical Path Forward

### Week 1 (Current) - Foundation
1. **App Functionality** ✅
   - App now loads successfully
   - All services running in Docker
   - Ready for development/testing

2. **TypeScript Cleanup** 🟡
   - Focus on critical app errors only
   - Ignore test file prop mismatches for now
   - Can be addressed incrementally

3. **Component Testing** 🔴
   - Find alternative to @testing-library/react-native
   - Consider snapshot testing
   - Focus on critical components

### Week 2 - Core Testing
1. **Integration Tests**
   - API endpoint testing
   - User flow testing
   - WebSocket functionality

2. **E2E Test Setup**
   - Detox configuration
   - Basic smoke tests
   - Critical path coverage

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions setup
   - Automated test runs
   - Basic deploy pipeline

### Week 3 - Advanced Testing
1. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing setup
   - Concurrent user tests
   - Database optimization

2. **Security Testing**
   - Basic security scans
   - Authentication tests
   - Authorization boundaries

3. **Accessibility**
   - Screen reader tests
   - Keyboard navigation
   - WCAG compliance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Today)
1. ✅ Verify app loads and runs correctly
2. ✅ Test basic user flows manually
3. 🟡 Start integration test implementation
4. 🟡 Set up basic CI/CD pipeline

### This Week
1. Complete integration tests for critical paths
2. Set up E2E test framework
3. Address only critical TypeScript errors
4. Begin accessibility testing

### Next Steps
1. Expand test coverage to 80%+
2. Implement visual regression tests
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Complete security audit

## Key Risks

1. **Component Testing** - Library issues may require alternative approach
2. **TypeScript Errors** - Many are non-critical, focus on app functionality
3. **Test Coverage** - Currently low for integration/E2E
4. **Performance** - Not yet validated under load

## Success Metrics

- App loads and functions correctly ✅
- Critical user flows work ✅
- 200+ tests passing ✅
- Docker services operational ✅
- Ready for further development ✅

## Summary

The app is now in a functional state with major infrastructure issues resolved. While there are still many TypeScript errors and testing gaps, the foundation is solid for continued development and testing. Focus should shift from infrastructure fixes to feature testing and user validation.
