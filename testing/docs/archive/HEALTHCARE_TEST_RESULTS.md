- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - doremon user now has hospital assignment

### 2. **Component Import Errors**
- **Problem**: HospitalSwitcher was importing non-existent components (Building, ChevronDown, Check)
- **Fix**: Changed to use Symbol component with proper icon names
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. **Modal Component Not Found**
- **Problem**: Modal was imported from feedback but doesn't exist there
- **Fix**: Changed to use Dialog component from overlay
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 4. **Connection Error Spam**

- **Fix**: Disabled NetInfo monitoring in __DEV__ mode
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 5. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
- **Problem**: Syntax errors in test scripts
- **Fix**: Fixed comment syntax in multiple files
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Components to Test:

- [ ] Shift status
- [ ] Metrics overview
- [ ] Alert summary
- [ ] Quick navigation buttons

### Alerts Screen (`/alerts`)
- [ ] Alert list display
- [ ] Alert filters (search, urgency, status)
- [ ] Create alert button (permission-based)
- [ ] Alert details navigation

### Alert Details Screen
- [ ] Alert information display
- [ ] Acknowledge/resolve buttons
- [ ] Alert timeline
- [ ] Escalation status

### Hospital Selection Modal

## API Endpoints to Test:

1. `healthcare.getAvailableHospitals` - Get hospitals for user's organization
2. `healthcare.joinHospital` - Join a hospital
3. `healthcare.getActiveAlerts` - Get active alerts for hospital
4. `healthcare.createAlert` - Create new alert
5. `healthcare.acknowledgeAlert` - Acknowledge an alert
6. `healthcare.resolveAlert` - Resolve an alert
7. `healthcare.getHealthcareMetrics` - Get dashboard metrics
8. `healthcare.getOnDutyStaff` - Get staff on duty
9. `healthcare.getAlertTimeline` - Get alert timeline events

## Known Issues to Monitor:

1. **WebSocket Connection**: Alert subscriptions may fail if WebSocket server is not running
2. **Hospital Context**: Ensure all healthcare queries include valid hospitalId
3. **Permissions**: Check role-based access for create/acknowledge/resolve actions
4. **Session Sync**: After joining hospital, ensure session is refreshed properly

## Test Users:
- **doremon@gmail.com** (nurse) - Has hospital assignment
- **doctor.test@example.com** (doctor) - No hospital assignment (good for testing flow)

## Next Steps:
1. Test each component manually in the app
2. Verify all API endpoints work with proper hospital context
3. Test error recovery flows
4. Test real-time alert updates via WebSocket
