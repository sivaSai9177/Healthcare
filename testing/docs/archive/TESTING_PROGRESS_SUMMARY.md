# Testing Progress Summary

## Current Status (June 18, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Unit Tests** - 74 tests passing (100% success rate)
   - Healthcare validation logic
   - Response time calculations
   - Alert utilities
   - Escalation timer service
   - Alert creation logic

2. **Integration Tests Written** - 5 major flows completed
   - Alert creation flow
   - Escalation flow
   - Shift handover flow
   - Patient management flow
   - Analytics flow

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Test utilities created (`__tests__/helpers/test-utils.ts`)
   - Jest configuration complete
   - Mocking system implemented
   - date-fns dependency installed

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
   - Multi-node version testing (18.x, 20.x)
   - PostgreSQL and Redis services configured
   - Coverage reporting with Codecov
   - Security scanning included

### üöß In Progress
1. **Integration Tests** - Written but failing due to:
   - TextEncoder/TextDecoder issues (partially fixed)
   - Database connection issues in test environment
   - TRPC context setup problems

2. **Component Tests** - 1/3 passing
   - ActivityLogsBlock.simple.test.tsx ‚úÖ
   - ResponseAnalyticsDashboard.test.tsx ‚ùå (React component import issues)
   - ActivityLogsBlock.test.tsx ‚ùå (timeout issues)

### üìä Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 85% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 50% coverage (written, not all passing)
- **Component Tests**: 10% coverage
- **Overall**: ~48% coverage

## Issues to Fix

### High Priority
1. **Integration Test Environment**
   ```javascript
   // Error: TextEncoder is not defined
   // Fixed in jest.setup.js but may need additional configuration
   ```

2. **Component Import Errors**
   ```javascript
   // Error: React.jsx: type is invalid
   // Need to fix component exports/imports
   ```

3. **TRPC Mock Setup**
   ```javascript
   // Error: api.useUtils is not a function
   // Partially fixed but needs complete mock implementation
   ```

### Medium Priority
1. TypeScript errors (~2,380 remaining)
2. ESLint warnings (1,803 issues)
3. Component test timeouts

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Fix integration test database connection
2. Complete TRPC mock setup
3. Fix component import issues
4. Get all written tests passing

### This Week
1. Increase component test coverage to 50%
2. Set up E2E tests with Playwright/Detox
3. Fix remaining TypeScript errors
4. Add accessibility tests

### Next Sprint
1. Load testing with k6/Artillery
2. Visual regression tests
3. Security testing
4. API contract tests

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test:healthcare:all

# Run specific test suites
bun run test:healthcare:unit       # ‚úÖ Passing
bun run test:healthcare:integration # ‚ùå Failing (environment issues)
bun run test:healthcare:components  # ‚ö†Ô∏è  Partial pass

# Run with coverage
bun run test:healthcare:all --coverage

# Run CI locally
act -j test # Using GitHub Act tool
```

## Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Unit tests: 100% passing
- ‚ùå Integration tests: 0% passing (environment issues)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Component tests: 33% passing
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline: Created and ready
- ‚úÖ Test documentation: Complete

## Time Investment
- Unit tests: ‚úÖ Complete
- Integration tests: 2 hours (written, debugging needed)
- Component tests: 1 hour (partial)
- CI/CD setup: 30 minutes ‚úÖ
- Total: ~4 hours

## Blockers
1. Database connection in test environment
2. Component import resolution
3. TRPC context setup in tests

## Recommendations
1. Focus on fixing test environment issues first
2. Use snapshot testing for problematic components
3. Consider using MSW for API mocking instead of jest mocks
4. Add pre-commit hooks to run tests
