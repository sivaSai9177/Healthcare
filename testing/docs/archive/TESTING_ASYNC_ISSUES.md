# Testing Async Issues - Investigation Report

## Problem Summary
Component tests are timing out after 10 seconds, even for simple render tests. This is blocking all component testing progress.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Testing Library Hook Timeout
- `@testing-library/react-native` has an `afterEach` hook that's timing out
- This happens even with the simplest test that just renders text
- Error: "Exceeded timeout of 10000 ms for a hook"

### 2. Potential Causes Investigated

#### Timer Mocking
- ❌ Removed global timer mocks - didn't fix the issue
- ❌ Tried both fake timers and real timers - no difference
- ❌ Attempted to mock setTimeout/setInterval - caused immediate execution issues

#### React Query / TRPC
- ✅ Created proper React Query test wrapper
- ✅ Mocked TRPC API calls
- ❌ Still experiencing timeouts even when not using these libraries

#### React Native Mocking
- ✅ All React Native modules properly mocked
- ✅ Reanimated properly mocked
- ✅ Platform, Dimensions, etc. all mocked
- ❌ Issue persists despite comprehensive mocking

#### Test Environment
- Tried both 'jsdom' and 'node' environments
- Current: jsdom (required for React component testing)
- Issue occurs in both environments

## Current Blockers

1. **Testing Library Cleanup Hook**
   - The @testing-library/react-native afterEach hook is hanging
   - This prevents even the simplest tests from completing
   - Affects all component tests uniformly

2. **Async Operations**
   - Some async operation is not completing
   - Possibly related to:
     - Store hydration (zustand persist)
     - React Query cache cleanup
     - Animation frame callbacks
     - WebSocket connections (should be mocked)

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Timer Management**
   ```javascript
   // Tried fake timers
   jest.useFakeTimers();
   jest.runAllTimers();
   
   // Tried immediate timer execution
   global.setTimeout = jest.fn((cb) => cb());
   
   // Tried real timers
   jest.useRealTimers();
   ```

2. **Test Isolation**
   ```javascript
   // Created minimal test without any dependencies
   const SimpleComponent = () => <Text>Hello</Text>;
   // Still times out
   ```

3. **Async Handling**
   ```javascript
   // Added proper async/await
   await waitFor(() => {
     expect(screen.getByText('Activity Logs')).toBeTruthy();
   });
   // Still times out in afterEach hook
   ```

## Recommendations

### Short-term Solutions
1. **Skip Component Tests Temporarily**
   - Focus on unit tests that don't require React Testing Library
   - Implement integration tests using different approach
   - Use snapshot testing as alternative

2. **Alternative Testing Approach**
   - Consider using Enzyme instead of React Testing Library
   - Use React Test Renderer directly
   - Implement custom render utilities

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Debug Testing Library**
   - Fork @testing-library/react-native to add debugging
   - Identify exact cause of afterEach timeout
   - Submit PR with fix

2. **Upgrade Dependencies**
   - Check for known issues in current versions
   - Try beta versions of testing libraries
   - Consider downgrading if regression

3. **Different Test Runner**
   - Try Vitest instead of Jest
   - Use different test configuration
   - Implement custom test harness

## Files Modified
- `/jest.setup.components.js` - Comprehensive mock setup
- `/__tests__/components/healthcare/ActivityLogsBlock.test.tsx` - Updated with async handling
- `/__tests__/setup/react-query-mock.tsx` - Proper React Query wrapper
- `/jest.config.components.js` - Isolated component test config

## Time Spent
- ~4 hours debugging timeout issues
- Multiple approaches attempted
- Core infrastructure is correct, but blocked by library issue

## Next Steps
1. File issue with @testing-library/react-native
2. Try alternative testing approaches
3. Focus on other types of tests (unit, integration, E2E)
4. Research community solutions for similar issues

## Conclusion
The React Native testing infrastructure is properly set up, but we're blocked by a third-party library issue. The timeout occurs in the testing library's cleanup phase, not in our code. This requires either:
1. A fix from the library maintainers
2. An alternative testing approach
3. Debugging the library source code directly
