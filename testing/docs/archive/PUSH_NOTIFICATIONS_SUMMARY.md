# Push Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete push notification system has been implemented for the healthcare alert app using Expo Push Notifications.

## Database Schema
The system uses the existing `userDeviceTokens` table from `notification-schema.ts`:
- Stores push tokens per user
- Tracks platform (iOS/Android/Web)
- Manages device information
- Handles token expiration with active/inactive status

## Backend Implementation

### 1. API Endpoints (in `src/server/routers/user.ts`)
- `registerPushToken` - Register a new push token for a user
- `unregisterPushToken` - Mark a token as inactive
- `getPushTokens` - Get all tokens for the current user

### 2. Push Notification Service (`src/server/services/push-notifications.ts`)
- Uses `expo-server-sdk` for sending push notifications
- Supports sending to individual users or multiple users
- Handles invalid tokens and automatic cleanup
- Provides batch sending capabilities

### 3. Integration with Notification Service
The existing notification service (`notifications.ts`) has been updated to:
- Use Expo push service for the PUSH channel
- Support push notifications for all notification types
- Handle token enrichment from the database

### 4. Healthcare Integration
Push notifications are sent for:
- **Alert Creation**: All on-duty healthcare staff receive notifications
- **Alert Escalation**: Notifications sent to the appropriate role tier
- **Alert Acknowledgment**: Alert creator is notified when their alert is acknowledged

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Push Notification Hook (`hooks/usePushNotifications.ts`)
- Manages push notification permissions
- Handles token registration/unregistration
- Sets up notification listeners
- Routes users based on notification type when tapped

### 2. Settings Component (`components/blocks/settings/PushNotificationSettings.tsx`)
- Visual interface for managing push notifications
- Shows active devices and tokens
- Allows testing notifications
- Provides enable/disable functionality

### 3. Test Screen (`app/(modals)/test-push-notifications.tsx`)
- Developer tool for testing push notifications
- Shows current status and permissions
- Allows sending test alerts

## Configuration

### app.json
Push notifications are configured with:
```json
{
  "expo-notifications": {
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",
    "color": "#FF1493",
    "androidMode": "default",
    "androidCollapsedTitle": "#{unread_notifications} new notifications"
  }
}
```

### iOS
- Info.plist includes `NSUserNotificationUsageDescription`

## Usage

### For Users:
1. Go to Settings > Push Notifications
2. Click "Enable Push Notifications"
3. Grant permission when prompted
4. Notifications will be received for:
   - New alerts (healthcare staff)
   - Alert escalations
   - Alert acknowledgments (operators)

### For Developers:
1. Test using the script: `bun run scripts/test-push-notifications.ts`
2. Use the test screen at `/(modals)/test-push-notifications`
3. Monitor logs for push notification events

## Notification Flow

1. **Alert Created** → Push to all on-duty healthcare staff
2. **Alert Escalated** → Push to next tier of responders
3. **Alert Acknowledged** → Push to alert creator
4. **Shift Summary** → Email only (configurable)

## Token Management

- Tokens are automatically registered when users enable notifications
- Invalid tokens are marked inactive automatically
- Users can see all their active devices in settings
- Tokens are cleaned up when users disable notifications

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are associated with authenticated users only
- Platform validation ensures correct token format
- Expired tokens are handled gracefully
- Push notification data doesn't contain sensitive patient information

## Next Steps

1. Implement notification categories for interactive notifications
2. Add notification scheduling for shift reminders
3. Implement quiet hours support
4. Add analytics for notification delivery rates
5. Create admin dashboard for notification management
