# Session Navigation Error Fix

## Update: Session Manager Forcing Login Issue

### Problem
After fixing the navigation routes, the session timeout manager was still forcing users to the login screen even when they had valid sessions. This was happening because:
1. The session timeout manager was checking session validity too aggressively
2. It was misinterpreting the session response format from Better Auth
3. Periodic session checks were conflicting with the SyncProvider's session management

### Solution
1. **Disabled periodic session checks** in SessionTimeoutManager since SyncProvider already handles session refresh via TanStack Query
2. **Improved session response handling** to support various Better Auth response formats
3. **Made timeout handling less aggressive** - now checks if user is actually authenticated before clearing session
4. **Separated concerns**:
   - SessionTimeoutManager: Only handles inactivity timeout
   - SyncProvider: Handles session validity and refresh

### Key Changes:
- Commented out the periodic `checkSession` calls
- Added validation in `handleTimeout` to prevent clearing valid sessions
- Better error handling for network/parsing errors vs actual auth errors

## Problem
The app was experiencing navigation errors on mobile during session sync intervals. The error message was:
```
[ROUTER] Screen doesn't exist: /(auth)/login
```

This was happening because:
1. Multiple files were using incorrect route paths `/(auth)/login` instead of `/(public)/auth/login`
2. During session refresh intervals on mobile (using bearer tokens), when the session expired or encountered errors, the app would try to navigate to non-existent routes
3. The navigation errors would cause the app to crash or show error screens

## Root Cause
The routes were reorganized during the app structure migration, but several navigation files weren't updated with the new paths:
- Auth routes moved from `/(auth)/` to `/(public)/auth/`
- Home route moved from `/(home)` to `/(app)/(tabs)/home`

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Incorrect Routes
Updated the following files with correct route paths:
- `lib/navigation/navigation-helper.ts`
- `components/providers/SessionProvider.tsx`
- `components/blocks/auth/OAuthErrorHandler/OAuthErrorHandler.tsx`
- `components/blocks/auth/ProfileCompletion/ProfileCompletionFlowMigrated.tsx`
- `components/blocks/auth/SessionTimeoutWarning/SessionTimeoutWarning.tsx`

### 2. Created Centralized Route Constants
Created `lib/navigation/routes.ts` to centralize all route paths:
```typescript
export const ROUTES = {
  PUBLIC: {
    LOGIN: '/(public)/auth/login',
    REGISTER: '/(public)/auth/register',
    // ... other public routes
  },
  APP: {
    HOME: '/(app)/(tabs)/home',
    ALERTS: '/(app)/(tabs)/alerts',
    // ... other app routes
  },
  // ... modal routes
};
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
Added better error handling in `SyncProvider` to:
- Prevent navigation loops when receiving HTML responses (404 errors)
- Only clear auth on actual 401 errors, not on routing/parsing errors
- Better logging for debugging session sync issues

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Run the app on mobile (iOS/Android)
2. Wait for session refresh interval (4 minutes)
3. Check that no navigation errors occur
4. Test session timeout scenarios
5. Test app background/foreground transitions

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use the centralized `ROUTES` constants for navigation
2. Update route constants when changing app structure
3. Test navigation thoroughly on all platforms after route changes
4. Use TypeScript for route type safety
