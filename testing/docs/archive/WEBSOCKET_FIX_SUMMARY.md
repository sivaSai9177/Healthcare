# WebSocket Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The app was stuck loading because the WebSocket server wasn't starting properly. The startup script was trying to run it locally with Node.js, but it should be running in Docker.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated startup script** (`scripts/start-with-healthcare.sh`):
   - Added `USE_DOCKER_WEBSOCKET=true` configuration
   - Script now uses Docker WebSocket by default

2. **Fixed environment variables** (`.env`):
   - Added `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WS=true`
   - Ensured `EXPO_PUBLIC_WS_PORT=3002`

3. **Started WebSocket container**:
   - Container name: `myexpo-websocket-local`
   - Running on port 3002
   - Logs show it's working properly

## To Start the App

1. **Stop current processes** (Ctrl+C)

2. **Restart with**:
   ```bash
   bun run local:healthcare
   ```

3. **The app should now load** at http://localhost:8081

## Verify WebSocket is Running

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep websocket

# View logs
docker logs myexpo-websocket-local

# Check port
lsof -i :3002
```

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure no other process is using port 3002
4. Check Docker container logs for errors

The WebSocket server is now properly running in Docker and the app should load successfully!
