## Priority 2: Complete Test Coverage

### Component Render Tests (0% → 90%)
Components needing render tests:
- [ ] `AlertList.tsx` - Different alert states, empty state, loading
- [ ] `AlertCreationForm.tsx` - Form validation, submission
- [ ] `PatientCard.tsx` - Various patient states
- [ ] `ActivePatients.tsx` - Patient list rendering
- [ ] `MetricsOverview.tsx` - Metric cards, charts
- [ ] `ShiftStatus.tsx` - Shift transitions
- [ ] `EscalationTimer.tsx` - Timer countdown
- [ ] `AlertFilters.tsx` - Filter interactions
- [ ] `ResponseAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Chart rendering
- [ ] `ActivityLogsBlock.tsx` - Log entries, search

### Integration Tests (15% → 80%)
User flows to test:
- [x] **Alert Creation Flow** ✅
  - Operator creates alert → Notification sent → Nurse acknowledges → Doctor responds → Alert resolved
- [x] **Escalation Flow** ✅
  - Alert created → No response → Auto-escalate to doctor → No response → Escalate to head doctor
- [x] **Shift Handover Flow** ✅
  - Current shift summary → Handover notes → Shift transition → New shift starts
- [x] **Patient Management Flow** ✅
  - Add patient → Update info → Assign to room → Create alert → Track history
- [x] **Analytics Flow** ✅
  - Generate metrics → Filter by date → Export report → Share insights
