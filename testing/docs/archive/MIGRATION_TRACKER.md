| theme | 3 blocks | ✅ Good | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ❌ Not checked | ❌ Not checked | N/A |

### Block Issues Identified
1. ✅ **Missing imports**: AlertList and MetricsOverview using `healthcareColors` without import - FIXED: Using semantic variants instead
2. **TODO in code**: AlertDashboard has TODO for manual escalation implementation
3. **Duplicates**: Multiple debug panel implementations need consolidation
4. **Misplaced components**: AppSidebar, TeamSwitcher in navigation should move to universal

### Fixes Applied
- **AlertList.tsx**: 
  - Replaced `healthcareColors` with semantic variants (destructive, secondary, default)
  - Added `cn` utility import for className management
  - Fixed `getUrgencyColor` to `getUrgencyVariant` returning proper variant names
  - Updated Card to use Tailwind border classes instead of inline styles

### Migration Pattern Examples

#### 1. Replace useTheme with Tailwind classes:
```tsx
// ❌ Old
const theme = useTheme();
style={{ backgroundColor: theme.background }}

// ✅ New
className="bg-background"
```

#### 2. Replace hardcoded colors with semantic variants:
```tsx
// ❌ Old
color={urgency > 3 ? '#ef4444' : '#3b82f6'}

// ✅ New
variant={urgency > 3 ? 'destructive' : 'primary'}
```

#### 3. Use shadow hook instead of platform tokens:
```tsx
// ❌ Old
shadow={PLATFORM_TOKENS.shadow?.md}

// ✅ New
const shadowStyle = useShadow({ size: 'md' });
style={[shadowStyle, otherStyles]}
```

#### 4. Implement responsive design:
```tsx
// ✅ Add
const { isMobile, isTablet } = useResponsive();
const { getValue } = useResponsiveValue();
size={getValue({ mobile: 'sm', tablet: 'md', desktop: 'lg' })}
```
