# Google OAuth Test Results

## Test Summary
Based on the testing performed, here's the current status of Google OAuth implementation:

### ‚úÖ Working Components
1. **OAuth Redirect** - `/api/auth/google` successfully redirects to Google
2. **CORS Headers** - Properly configured on all endpoints
3. **State Cookie** - CSRF protection cookie is set correctly
4. **Google OAuth URL** - Properly formatted with correct parameters

### ‚ùå Issues Identified
1. **Better Auth Routes Return 404**
   - `/api/auth/session` ‚Üí 404
   - `/api/auth/callback/google` ‚Üí 500
   - Base `/api/auth` ‚Üí 404
   
2. **Better Auth Handler Issue**
   - The catch-all route handler is being called
   - But Better Auth is not handling the routes internally
   - This suggests a configuration or initialization problem

### üîç Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be that Better Auth's internal routes are not being recognized. This could be due to:
1. Better Auth not being properly initialized
2. A mismatch between the expected route format and what's being called
3. Missing middleware or configuration

### üöÄ Recommended Next Steps
1. **Manual Browser Test**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:8081/auth/login
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Observe the full OAuth flow
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Monitor network tab for failed requests

2. **Check Docker Logs**
   - Look for Better Auth initialization errors
   - Check for database connection issues
   - Monitor OAuth callback attempts

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Ensure GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID is set
   - Ensure GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET is set
   - Confirm BETTER_AUTH_SECRET is set

### üìù Test Commands Used
```bash
# Test OAuth redirect
curl -I http://localhost:8081/api/auth/google

# Test session endpoint
curl http://localhost:8081/api/auth/session

# Test callback endpoint
curl http://localhost:8081/api/auth/callback/google

# Test base auth route
curl http://localhost:8081/api/auth
```

### üéØ Current Focus
The immediate priority is to fix the Google OAuth login with cookie-based authentication as requested. The OAuth redirect is working, but the callback handling needs to be fixed.
