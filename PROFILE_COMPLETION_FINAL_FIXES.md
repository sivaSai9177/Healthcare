# Profile Completion Final Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Bio Input Improvements (Step 3)
- **Changed variant**: From `variant="filled"` to `variant="outline"` for better theme consistency
- **Increased height**: 
  - `numberOfLines` increased from 6 to 8
  - `minHeight` increased from 120px to 160px
  - Added padding: top/bottom 16px (was 12px)
  - Added proper `fontSize: 16` and `lineHeight: 24` for better readability
- **Better placeholder text**: More descriptive guidance for users
- **Added info alert**: "Almost Done!" message to guide users at the final step

### 2. Role-Specific Information Cards (Step 2)
Added informative alerts for each role when selecting organization:

- **Healthcare Professionals (Doctor, Nurse, Head Doctor)**:
  - Title: "Healthcare Professional Workspace"
  - Info: Access to patient alerts, shift management, and healthcare collaboration tools
  - Can join existing hospital or create healthcare organization

- **Emergency Operator**:
  - Title: "Emergency Operator Dashboard"
  - Info: Real-time emergency alerts, dispatch tools, and communication systems
  - Can join existing emergency center or set up dispatch organization

- **Manager**:
  - Title: "Management Dashboard"
  - Info: Team management, analytics, and organizational tools
  - Can create or join organization to manage teams

- **Administrator**:
  - Title: "Administrator Access"
  - Info: Full system access with user management and audit capabilities
  - Can join or create organization to manage

### 3. TypeScript Fixes
- Fixed React Native `Alert` import conflict by renaming to `RNAlert`
- Added proper imports for `Alert` component and `Symbol` from universal components
- Fixed `cleanedFormData` scope issue in error handling
- Changed default role from empty string to 'guest' to satisfy type requirements

### 4. Theme Consistency
- All components now use proper theme colors
- Bio input follows the same Input component pattern as other fields
- Info cards use appropriate variant colors (info for healthcare, default for others)
- Maintained dark mode support throughout

## Auth Flow Verification

The registration flow is correctly implemented:

1. **Registration** → User created with `needsProfileCompletion: true`
2. **Index redirect** → Checks if profile completion needed, redirects to `/auth/complete-profile`
3. **Profile completion** → User fills out additional info including:
   - Step 1: Name, Role, Job Title
   - Step 2: Organization/Hospital (with role-specific info cards)
   - Step 3: Bio and Terms acceptance
4. **Completion** → Updates user with `needsProfileCompletion: false` and redirects to `/home`
