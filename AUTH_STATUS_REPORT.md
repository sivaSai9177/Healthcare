# Auth Status Report

## ‚úÖ What's Working Now

1. **Sign In via tRPC**
   - `POST /api/trpc/auth.signIn` works correctly
   - Returns user data and Bearer token
   - Credentials: demo@example.com / SecurePassword123!

2. **Bearer Token Authentication**
   - Token is returned on successful sign-in
   - Token works when passed in Authorization header
   - Session data is retrieved successfully with Bearer token

3. **Temporary Token Storage**
   - Added localStorage storage for Bearer token on web
   - Token is stored in `auth-token` key
   - Token age is tracked to expire after 24 hours

4. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout auth flow
   - logger.store.debug() method added to UnifiedLogger
   - Auth state changes are now tracked

## ‚ùå What's Still Broken

1. **No HTTP-Only Cookies**
   - Better Auth endpoints return 404
   - No secure cookies are being set
   - Session doesn't persist on page refresh without manual token handling

2. **Better Auth Integration**
   - `/api/auth/*` endpoints all return 404
   - The catch-all route handler seems to not be passing requests to Better Auth
   - This breaks OAuth flows and secure cookie management

3. **Sign Out Issues**
   - tRPC sign out needs proper content-type header
   - No cookie clearing since cookies aren't set

## üîß Current Workaround

The app now stores the Bearer token in localStorage and uses it for requests:

```javascript
// On sign-in success
localStorage.setItem('auth-token', token);

// On requests
headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
```

This is not ideal for security but makes the app functional.

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Fix Better Auth Routes**
   - Debug why the catch-all route isn't working
   - Ensure Better Auth handler receives requests properly
   - Test cookie setting with native Better Auth endpoints

2. **Implement Proper Cookie Management**
   - Once Better Auth works, remove localStorage workaround
   - Ensure HTTP-only, secure cookies are set
   - Test session persistence across page refreshes

3. **Complete Auth Flow Testing**
   - Test OAuth flows (Google sign-in)
   - Test profile completion flow
   - Test role-based access control
   - Test session timeouts

## üéØ Immediate Tasks

1. The app should now work with sign-in using the Bearer token approach
2. Users can sign in with demo@example.com / SecurePassword123!
3. The session will persist until page refresh (then requires sign-in again)

## üêõ Known Issues

1. Page refresh loses session (no cookies)
2. OAuth won't work until Better Auth routes are fixed
3. Sign out needs to be tested with the new token approach

The auth system is functional but not secure or complete. The Bearer token workaround allows development to continue while we fix the underlying Better Auth integration.
